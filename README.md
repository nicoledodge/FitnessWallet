## User Story

```md
AS AN avid traveller 
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection SO 
THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit   
THEN that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.
